Netflix is one of the most popular OTT streaming platforms. People who are highly active in stock market investments always keep an eye on companies like Netflix because of its popularity. If you are one of them who would like to learn about how to predict the stock prices of Netflix with machine learning, this project is for you. In this project, I will take you through the task of Netflix stock price prediction with Machine Learning using Python.

To predict the stock prices of Netflix with machine learning, I have used the LSTM neural network as it is one of the best approaches for regression analysis and time series forecasting.

The dataset is collected using the yFinance API in Python. 

To train the LSTM model, the data is first split into training and test sets.
